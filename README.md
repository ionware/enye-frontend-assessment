## Enye Frontend Assessment
Made with React + Tailwind using `create-react-app` with `craco`. Visit [https://enye-feass.netlify.app](https://enye-feass.netlify.app) for a working Demo.

## What's missing?
- Filters. Yup. I actually completed this under 4hrs; Phobia for UI wouldn't let me realize that my deadline is near (plus, I ~~dislike~~ love frontend).

## Getting it to run
But there is a Demo. Anyway, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine (Node.js >= 12), and NPM. Then follow (or just copy) this procedure:

1. Clone the repository (of course you have Git)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ionware/enye-frontend-assessment.git
   ```
2. Change directory into what you just cloned
   ```bash
   cd enye-frontend-assessment
   ```
3. Install all dependencies   
   ```npm
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the app
   ```npm
   npm start
   ```

Period.
